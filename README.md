#COMP125 - Client-Side Web Development

This repository contains the hands-on exercises and assignments from the Client-Side Web Development (COMP125) course at Centennial College. This course dives deep into core JavaScript concepts and advanced features to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Key Concepts Covered:
- JavaScript Fundamentals: Learning the syntax, functions, data types, and operators essential for JavaScript development.
